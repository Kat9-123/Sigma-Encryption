# Sigma-Encryption
An encyption programme based on the enigma machine.
<b> This is still under development!!! <b>


This programme uses the Unity game engine. Only because the language I'm best at is C# + Unity.

(I know Unity isn't really meant for stuff like this)



Coming soon:
Decryption, Salt, Cleaner and better code & Better comments
